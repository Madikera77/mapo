              1 2801236 Unused privilege is detected. [Defect]
      There are unused privileges among the privileges declared in the
                   config.xml of the Application package.
                              [Expected Result]
    Unused privileges must be deleted from the privileges declared in the
                   config.xml of the Application package.
                                 [Reference]
   The application must be able to access only necessary resources to its
                             legitimate purpose.
     It's known as the principle of minimal privilege in the information
                                  security.
     If Tizen applications are not follow this principle it will cause a
                               security issue.
       See the attached file for further details on unused privileges.
